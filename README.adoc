Useful tips for configuring `zsh` without frameworks like oh-my-zsh and prezto.

== Editing (ZLE)

=== Run a command without losing current command line input

Use `Alt + Q` to save the current command line and execute another command. Afterwards
the old command line is restored automatically (uses the `push-line` ZLE command):

[source,zsh]
----
$ cp file1 ~/dir1  # press alt+q
$                  # command line goes blank
$ ls ~/dir1        # execute a command
$ cp file1 ~/dir1  # old command line restored
----
